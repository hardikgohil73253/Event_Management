# Eventify

* *Description*: Event organizers can create an event, and students planning to attend any of those events can directly make a booking using our application. The event organizer will have to obtain approval for every event to avoid any unlawful events from getting promoted. Admin will handle the approval of events, and organizers will be notified of the decision.
